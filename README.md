# Number

A library that implements WASM's specification of integers. Specifically this
defines integers, both signed and unsigned, that can be selected to have an
arbitrary number of bits and then perform a wide variety of operations on them.

WASM spec for [integer operations](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/exec/numerics.html#integer-operations)

Originally derived from [James Gallichio](https://github.com/JamesGallicchio)'s
implementation of [Int32](https://github.com/T-Brick/c0deine/blob/7af2ffc28024d6d26b2c57185adcfbc191ea34a1/C0deine/Utils/Int32.lean)
